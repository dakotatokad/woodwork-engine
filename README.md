# woodwork-engine
Welcome to woodwork-engine, an AI Agent IaC tool that aims to make developing and deploying AI Agents easier.

Through defining components in a configuration language, an LLM will decompose the task into actionable steps, which can be executed using the supplied tools. We use latest research to inform design decisions, and we implement this as most of the setup is copy/paste across projects. Through only focussing on the necessary components of a system, this package should make designing custom, vertical agents much easier.
